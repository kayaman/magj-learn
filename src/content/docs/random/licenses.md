This page provides an overview of the most widely used software licenses, focusing on open-source options. Each license includes a summary, its importance, use cases, and notable examples.

## **1. GNU General Public License (GPL)**

- **Why it's important**: Ensures strong copyleft, requiring derivative works to remain open-source.
- **Use case**: Best for projects that prioritize openness and collaboration while preventing proprietary modifications.
- **Notable examples**: Linux Kernel, GNU utilities.

## **2. MIT License**

- **Why it's important**: A permissive license that allows for broad usage while only requiring attribution.
- **Use case**: Ideal for projects seeking maximum adoption with minimal restrictions.
- **Notable examples**: React, Node.js, Ruby on Rails.

## **3. Apache License 2.0**

- **Why it's important**: Includes explicit patent rights, allowing both open-source and proprietary use.
- **Use case**: Suitable for projects that need patent protection while enabling commercial use.
- **Notable examples**: Kubernetes, TensorFlow, Apache HTTP Server.

## **4. BSD Licenses (2-Clause, 3-Clause)**

- **Why it's important**: Similar to MIT but with additional clauses for liability limitation and non-endorsement.
- **Use case**: Good for software that aims for wide reuse with minimal legal overhead.
- **Notable examples**: FreeBSD, OpenBSD, SQLite.

## **5. Mozilla Public License (MPL)**

- **Why it's important**: A hybrid license that requires modifications to licensed files to remain open-source while allowing proprietary integration.
- **Use case**: Ideal for balancing openness with commercial interests.
- **Notable examples**: Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird.

## **6. Eclipse Public License (EPL)**

- **Why it's important**: Stronger copyleft than MPL but more business-friendly than GPL.
- **Use case**: Often used in enterprise-level open-source development.
- **Notable examples**: Eclipse IDE, IBM projects.

## **7. Creative Commons Licenses (CC0, BY, BY-SA, etc.)**

- **Why it's important**: Commonly used for non-software content but sometimes applicable to documentation.
- **Use case**: Suitable for sharing documentation, media, and data.
- **Notable examples**: Wikipedia content, Open Data projects.

## **8. Unlicense & CC0 (Public Domain)**

- **Why it's important**: Removes all copyright restrictions, allowing full public domain usage.
- **Use case**: Best for projects where unrestricted reuse is the goal.
- **Notable examples**: Some utility libraries and small scripts.

## **9. Affero GPL (AGPL)**

- **Why it's important**: Extends GPL to network-based applications, ensuring modifications remain open-source.
- **Use case**: Ideal for SaaS and web-based applications to prevent closed-source forks.
- **Notable examples**: Nextcloud, Open edX.

## **10. Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL)**

- **Why it's important**: A permissive license from Microsoft, allowing broad use with some restrictions.
- **Use case**: Useful for Microsoft-related open-source projects.
- **Notable examples**: Some .NET libraries.
