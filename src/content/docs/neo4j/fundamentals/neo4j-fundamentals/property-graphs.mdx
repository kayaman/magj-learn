## Property graph

In the previous module we referred to nodes and relationships as the fundamental building blocks for a graph. In this lesson you will learn about the additional elements that Neo4j supports to make a property graph.

Nodes, Labels and Properties
Recall that nodes are the graph elements that represent the things in our data. We can use two additional elements to provide some extra context to the data.

Let’s take a look at how we can use these additional elements to improve our social graph.

## Labels

By adding a label to a node, we are signifying that the node belongs to a subset of nodes within the graph. Labels are important in Neo4j because they provide a starting point for a Cypher statement.

Let’s take Michael and Sarah - in this context both of these nodes are persons.

We can embellish the graph by adding more labels to these nodes; Michael identifies as male and Sarah is female. In this context, Michael is an employee of a company, but we don’t have any information about Sarah’s employment status.

Michael works for a company called Graph Inc, so we can add that label to the node that represents a company.

In Neo4j, a node can have zero, one, or many labels.
