## The Seven Bridges

### Once upon a time…​

**To find out how we got here, we first need to take a trip back in time.**

It’s 1736, in Königsberg, Prussia.

Leonhard Euler is presumably sitting at his desk, with a dilemma. Kongsberg (modern day Kaliningrad, Russia) is divided by the Pregel River into four sections which are connected by seven bridges.

The question that Euler is pondering is: Can we take a walk through the city that would cross each of the seven bridges only once?

### Foundation for graph theory

He eventually solved the problem by reformulating it, and in doing so laid the foundations for graph theory.

He realized that the land masses themselves weren’t an important factor. In fact, it was the bridges that connected the land masses that were the most important thing.

His approach was to define the problem in abstract terms, taking each land mass and representing it as an abstract vertex or node, then connecting these land masses together with a set of seven edges that represent the bridges. These elements formed a “graph”.

### Applying the theory

Using this abstraction, Euler was able to definitively demonstrate that there was no solution to this problem. Regardless of where you enter this graph, and in which order you take the bridges, you can’t travel to every land mass without taking one bridge at least twice.

But it wasn’t a completely wasted effort. Although graphs originated in mathematics, they are also a very convenient way of modeling and analyzing data. While there is certainly value in the data that we hold, it is the connections between data that can really add value. Creating or inferring relationships between your records can yield real insights into a dataset.

Fast forward 300 years and these founding principles are used to solve complex problems including route finding, supply chain analytics, and real-time recommendations.

## Graph elements

Let’s take a closer look at the two elements that make up a graph:

Nodes (also known as vertices)

Relationships (also known as edges)

### Nodes

Nodes (or vertices) are the circles in a graph. Nodes commonly represent objects, entities, or merely things.

In the Seven Bridges of Königsberg example in the previous lesson, nodes were used to represent the land masses.

Another example that everyone can relate to is the concept of a social graph. People interact with each other and form relationships of varying strengths.

The diagram to the right has two nodes which represent two people, Michael and Sarah. On their own, these elements are uninspiring. But when we start to connect these circles together, things start to get interesting.

### Nodes typically represent things

Examples of entities that could typically be represented as a node are: person, product, event, book or subway station.

### Relationships

Two nodes representing Michael and Sarah and connected by a MARRIED_TO relationship
Relationships (or edges) are used to connect nodes. We can use relationships to describe how nodes are connected to each other. For example Michael has the WORKS_AT relationship to Graph Inc because he works there. Michael has the MARRIED_TO relationship to Sarah because he is married to her.

All of a sudden, we know that we are looking at the beginnings of some sort of social graph.

Now, let’s introduce a third person, Hans, to our Graph.

Hans also works for Graph Inc along with Michael. Depending on the size of the company and the properties of the relationship, we may be able to infer that Michael and Hans know each other.

If that is the case, how likely is it that Sarah and Hans know each other?

These are all questions that can be answered using a graph.

### Relationships are typically verbs.

We could use a relationship to represent a personal or professional connection (Person knows Person, Person married to Person), to state a fact (Person lives in Location, Person owns Car, Person rated Movie), or even to represent a hierarchy (Parent parent of Child, Software depends on Library).
