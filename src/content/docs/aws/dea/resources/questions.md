Which option describes the responsibility of the data engineer and the data analyst?

*The data engineer builds the system that delivers usable data to the data analyst, who analyzes the data to gain business insights.*

The data engineer builds a system that will deliver process and curated data for the data analyst. During the data discovery process, the data engineer can gather requirements from the data analyst so the system can deliver usable data.

What are some key functions of the data engineer?

- *They build and manage data infrastructure platforms.*
- *They catalog and document datasets.*
- *They ensure security and compliance.*

Some of the key data engineer functions are to build and manage data platforms, catalog datasets, and ensure security and compliance. Analyzing data, building visualization dashboards, and training ML models are typically the focus of the data scientist and data analyst.

What is the best definition of data discovery?

*The process of finding and understanding relevant data sources within an organization and the relationships between them*

Data discovery involves interactive sessions to identify key data sources and stakeholders, understand data, and determine how to maximize value from data through appropriate analysis and use cases. The other options describe parts of data discovery, but not the overall definition.

What are the steps in the data discovery process?

- *Identify key stakeholders and data sources across the organization.*
- *Discover existing data types and formats.*
- *Ingest and explore sample data to understand data types and structures.*

The data discovery process focuses on what data exists, how it can be accessed and transformed, and the ways to use it before defining implementation details.  
Establishing and testing disaster recovery routines is typically done after the discovery process when more information is known about the data landscape and requirements.   
Although reviewing documentation can provide useful background information, the data discovery process is more hands-on and involves interactive sessions with stakeholders.  
Ingesting, processing, and delivering data is the main function of the data analytics system itself, but not part of the discovery process.

Which questions are typically asked during the data discovery process?

- *Who are the key stakeholders and data owners?*
- *Which formats and types of data are available?*
- *How will the data be secured and accessed?*

Some typical data discovery questions focus on understanding the available data sources, formats, and volumes and establishing the high-level processing needs to maximize the value from data. Identifying the technical requirements for machine learning, which models are used, and which reference architectures are used come later in the process after the initial data discovery.
