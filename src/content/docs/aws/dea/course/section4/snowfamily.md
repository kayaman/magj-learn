## Data Migrations with AWS Snow Family

### Challenges

- Limited connectivity
- Limited bandwidth
- High network cost
- Shared bandwidth (canâ€™t maximize the line)
- Connection stability

**AWS Snow Family**: offline devices to perform data migrations
If it takes more than a week to transfer over the network, use Snowball
devices!
