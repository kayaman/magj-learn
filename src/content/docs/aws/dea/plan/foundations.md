## Introduction

### What are the key functions of the data engineer?

![key functions](/img/key-functions.png)

- Build and manage data infrastructure and platforms

    This includes setting up databases, data lakes, and data warehouses on AWS services like Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), AWS Glue, Amazon Redshift, among others. 

- Ingest data from various sources

    You can use tools like AWS Glue jobs or AWS Lambda functions to ingest data from databases, applications, files, and streaming devices into the centralized data platforms. 

- Prepare the ingested data for analytics

    Use technologies like AWS Glue, Apache Spark, or Amazon EMR to prepare data by cleaning, transforming, and enriching it.

- Catalog and document curated datasets

    Use AWS Glue crawlers to determine the format and schema, group data into tables, and write metadata to the AWS Glue Data Catalog. Use metadata tagging in Data Catalog for data governance and discoverability.

- Automate regular data workflows and pipelines

    Simplify and accelerate data processing using services like AWS Glue workflows, AWS Lambda, or AWS Step Functions.

- Ensure data quality, security, and compliance

## Data Discovery

### What is data discovery?

Before you can architect and deploy a data analytics system, the following questions must be answered:

- Which data should be analyzed? What is its value to the business or organization?
- Who owns the data? Where is it located?
- Is the data usable in its current state? What transformations are required?
- Who needs to see the data?
- After the data is curated and ready for consumption, how should it be presented?
  
These questions and others are typically answered during the data discovery process. Data discovery refers to the process of finding and understanding relevant data sources within an organization and the relationships between them. It is a crucial first step for extracting value from data assets. 

Data discovery is an important prerequisite to architecting and deploying a data analytics system, but it's also an ongoing process. The landscape changesâ€”new data sources emerge, opportunities arise, and new business goals are defined. The data discovery process keeps you ahead of this curve and able to respond with agility and accuracy.

### Data discovery steps

![dd-steps](/img/dd-steps.png)

- **Define business value**

Conduct data discovery kick-off workshops with stakeholders to understand business goals, prioritize use cases, and identify potential data sources.  
The following are example questions that define the business opportunity:

  - How would getting insight into data provide value to the business?
  - Are you looking to create a new revenue stream from your data?
  - What are the challenges with your current approach and tool? 
  - Would your business benefit from managing fraud detection, predictive maintenance, and root-cause analysis to reduce mean time to detection and mean time to recovery?
  - How are you continually innovating on behalf of your customers and improving their user experience?

- **Identify your data consumers**
  
Conduct interactive sessions with various stakeholders within an organization such as data scientists and analysts.  
The following example questions can help identify your data consumers:

  - Who are the end users (for example, business analysts, data engineers, data analysts, or data scientists)? 
  - Which insights are you currently getting from your data?
  - Which insights are on your roadmap?
  - What are the different consumption models?
  - Which tool or interface do your data consumers use?
  - How real time does the data need to be for this use case (for example, near real time, every 15 minutes, hourly, or daily)? 
  - What is the total number of consumers for this consumption model?
  - What is the peak concurrency?

- **Identify your data sources**

| Data types | Example data types |
|------------|--------------------|
| Structured data	| Relational databases, spreadsheets, CSV files, XML |
| Semi-structured data | Non-relational databases, JSON, Log files,  XML with attributes, Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data |
| Unstructured data	| Text documents, images, audio files, video files |

| Data sources	| Example data sources |
|---------------|----------------------|

| Datasets	| Demographic data, weather data, geospatial mapping, transportation data |

| Ingest modes | Example ingest modes |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Streaming	| Sensors, social media platforms, media and entertainment services, IoT devices |
| Micro-batch |	Sensors, website logs, graphics and video rendering |
| Batch	| Medical imagery, genomic data, financial records, usage data |

The following example questions can help identify your data types,  data sources, and ingest modes:

  - How many data sources do you have to support?
  - Where and how is the data generated?
  - What are the different types of data? 
  - What are the different formats of data? 
  - Is your data originating from on premises, a third-party vendor, or the cloud?
  - Is the data source streaming, batch, or micro-batch?
  - What is the velocity and volume of ingestion?
  - What is the ingestion interface? 
  - How does your team onboard new data sources?

- **Define your storage, catalog, and data access needs**

Determine the best storage for specific data types. Assess data quality to determine processing needs. Catalog and register details about data sources.  
The following are example questions to identify your data storage and data access requirements:

  - Which data stores do you have?
  - What is the purpose of each data store?
  - Why are you using that storage method?  (for example, files, SQL, NoSQL, or a data warehouse)
  - How do you currently organize your data? (for example, data tiering or partition)
  - How much data are you storing now, and how much do you expect to store in the future? (for example, 18 months from now)
  - How do you manage data governance? 
  - Which regulatory and governance compliance standards are applicable to you? 
  - What is your disaster recovery (DR) strategy?

- **Define your data processing requirements**
  
Extract relevant data from sources like databases, data lakes, and CRM systems using tools such as AWS Glue crawlers or custom scripts.  
Curate and transform the raw data as needed using services like AWS Glue and Amazon EMR.  
The following example questions can help identify your data processing requirements:

  - Do you have to transform or enrich the data before you consume it?
  - Which tools do you use for transforming your data?
  - Do you have a visual editor for the transformation code? 
  - What is the frequency of your data transformation? (for example, real time, micro-batching, overnight batch) 
  - Are there any constraints with your current tool of choice?

## AWS Data Services and the Modern Data Architecture

![Data Workflow](/img/data-workflow.png)

1. Ingest

    Data of various types and from multiple sources is ingested into the system.

2. Store

    Data is stored in a centralized repository rather than in departmental silos. 

3. Catalog

    Data is cataloged, indexed, and tagged to facilitate search and retrieval.

4. Process

    Much of the data in raw form is not usable for analysis. In the process stage, data is transformed into more usable formats.

5. Deliver for consumption

    Processed data is delivered to consumers and stakeholders for visualization and analysis.

**The following is a partial list of AWS services that can be used in data analytics systems. Some services can be used in multiple workflow stages.**

## Orchestration and Automation Options

**Orchestration** is the process of coordinating multiple services to define and manage the flow of data through a series of steps. It involves defining workflows and dependencies between steps. 

**Automation** refers to using tools and services to automate repetitive tasks related to data ingestion, processing, and analytics.

Automation is suitable for simple repetitive tasks. Orchestration is needed for complex workflows involving the coordination of multiple services, teams, and dependencies across stages.

Typically, they are used together in analytics workflows. For example, orchestration could involve coordinating multiple automated tasks in a defined sequence. Together, orchestration and automation can streamline operations, improve reliability, and empower non-programmers to manage complex workflows.

### Options for orchestration and automation



- AWS Step Functions

  Step Functions is a visual workflow service to orchestrate and automate workflows, pipelines, and processes. Step Functions ensures tasks run in the correct order. It does the following:

  - Orchestrates ETL workflows by connecting Lambda functions that extract the data from sources, transform it, and load it into databases and data lakes. 
  - Runs batch jobs on data in AWS Glue, AWS EMR, or other services. 
  - Processes streaming data by connecting Lambda functions processing data from Kinesis Data Streams or Amazon Data Firehose for real-time analytics.

- AWS Lambda

  Lambda runs code (called Lambda functions) without provisioning or managing servers. Combined with Step Functions, Lambda functions can invoke AWS services and microservices and perform tasks to that are part of orchestrated workflows.

  - Lambda functions can be invoked by events from data sources like Amazon S3, DynamoDB, or Kinesis Data Streams to process incoming data in real time.
  - Step Functions can be used to orchestrate multiple Lambda functions for error handling, retries, and visualizations. 
  - Lambda functions can be used in event-driven architectures with services like Amazon SNS and Amazon SQS to decouple and coordinate different analytics tasks.

- Amazon MWAA

  Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (Amazon MWAA) can be used to orchestrate data analytics workflows on AWS.

  - Amazon MWAA workflows can be configured to ingest, process, transform, and load data into databases and data warehouses. Amazon MWAA can also be used to run queries on the data for analysis.
  - Amazon MWAA workflows handle dependencies, support parallel running of tasks, and ensure tasks run sequentially.
  - Through Amazon MWAA, Apache Airflow workers can be scaled dynamically based on workload.

- Amazon EventBridge

  Amazon EventBridge is a serverless service used to build event-driven applications. It employs loosely coupled applications that work together by emitting and responding to events. 

  - EventBridge can ingest events from various sources, and then route these events to different targets for processing or action. Athena can run SQL queries, and Lambda functions can drive custom processing.
  - Events coming into EventBridge can invoke workflows in Step Functions, which coordinates multiple AWS services in a data processing pipeline. 
  - EventBridge also supports built-in matching and routing rules that filter and transform events before delivering to targets. Therefore, event data can be pre-processed before analytics.

- Amazon SNS

  Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a fully managed messaging service. With Amazon SNS, applications and services can send messages to multiple endpoints simultaneously through SNS topics. 

  - SNS topics can be used to receive notifications and events from various data sources and AWS services. 
  - These events invoke Step Functions workflows, which coordinate AWS services like AWS Glue, Amazon Redshift, and Athena for data processing and analytics pipelines.
  - Features like message durability, encryption, and archiving help improve reliability of analytics workflows and help recover from failures.

- Amazon SQS

  Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) is a managed message queuing service to send, store, and retrieve multiple messages of various sizes asynchronously. 

  - Multiple users or systems can submit analytic jobs and tasks by sending messages to an SQS queue. This decouples the submitters from the jobs being processed.
  - Compute resources like EC2 instances can be designed to poll the SQS queue and pick up messages containing jobs. Processing can scale independently based on the number of messages in the queue.
  - Amazon SQS features include message attributes, dead letter queues, and integration with AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and SDKs. This makes Amazon SQS useful for building robust and scalable workflows.

### Enhancing orchestration and automation

#### Zero-ETL

Zero-ETL refers to an approach for data integration that minimizes or eliminates the need for ETL processes. With traditional ETL, data needs to be extracted from source systems, transformed or cleaned, and loaded into a data warehouse or data lake. These processes can be time-consuming and complex to develop and maintain.  
With zero-ETL integrations, data can be directly queried from its original sources without requiring data movement or transformation.  
Several AWS services support zero-ETL and can be used in orchestrated workflows.

- Amazon Athena

  With Athena, data stored in Amazon S3 can be queried by using SQL commands. It does not need to be extracted and loaded elsewhere. Step Functions can orchestrate Lambda functions to process and analyze the query results from Athena in real time. 

- Amazon Redshift streaming ingestion

  Amazon Redshift ingests streaming data in near real time at high throughput. Because it doesn't need to stage in Amazon S3, the need for some ETL tasks is eliminated.

- Amazon Aurora with Amazon Redshift

  Replicate data from some Aurora sources to Amazon Redshift in near real time for analytics. Zero-ETL seamlessly makes that data available in Amazon Redshift and removes the need to build and maintain complex ETL pipelines. Check current Aurora product documentation for a list of supported sources.

- Amazon Redshift auto copy from Amazon S3

  Continuously ingest new data files from Amazon S3 into Amazon Redshift with no manual intervention.

- Amazon OpenSearch Service

  OpenSearch Service has zero-ETL integration with Amazon S3 for querying data directly in Amazon S3 without extracting to OpenSearch. This improves query performance for log analysis use cases.

#### Serverless architecture

A serverless architecture is a way to build and run applications and services without having to manage infrastructure. Your application still runs on servers, but all the server management is done by AWS. Serverless architectures are extremely cost effective because you only pay for the actual time that your code is running.  
Efficiently orchestrated and automated workflows depend significantly on serverless applications.  
Many AWS services have serverless options or can be used in serverless workflows. 

- AWS Lambda

  Lambda is the primary serverless AWS service. It runs code called Lambda functions without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda functions can be invoked by other services or events and can also invoke other services to perform tasks.

- Amazon API Gateway

  With API Gateway, you can create RESTful and HTTP APIs that can integrate with AWS Lambda functions. You can build serverless applications where the business logic is run with Lambda. 

- Amazon DynamoDB

  DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database that does not require you to provision or manage any servers. Lambda functions can perform operations directly on DynamoDB tables without having to manage any underlying infrastructure. 

- Amazon S3

  Serverless applications often use Amazon S3 for file storage and hosting static websites.

- Amazon SNS

  Use Amazon SNS in serverless workflows to facilitate asynchronous communication between different AWS services.  
  For example, when you upload objects to Amazon S3, an Amazon S3 event can publish a message to an SNS topic. Lambda functions or other services can subscribe to this topic and process the object asynchronously.

- Amazon SQS

  Use SQS queues to connect serverless Lambda functions together into workflows. For example, a Lambda function could process a request and send a message to an SQS queue. That message could then invoke a separate Lambda function to perform further processing asynchronously.

- Amazon Redshift Serverless

  Amazon Redshift Serverless automatically provisions and scales resources to meet demand. Analytics can run without setting up and managing data warehouse infrastructure.

- Amazon EMR Serverless

  With Amazon EMR Serverless, you donâ€™t have to configure, optimize, secure, or operate clusters. You can avoid overprovisioning or underprovisioning resources for your data processing jobs.

- AWS Glue

  AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service. AWS Glue ETL jobs automatically scale. You don't need to manage infrastructure, and you only pay per use.

- Amazon MSK Serverless

  Amazon MSK offers a serverless option called MSK Serverless. With MSK Serverless, you can run Apache Kafka clusters without having to manage and scale infrastructure. It provides pay-per-use pricing, automatic scaling, and high availability.

- Amazon OpenSearch Service Serverless

  OpenSearch Service Serverless streamlines running petabyte-scale search and analytics workloads and automatically provisions and scales underlying resources without needing to manage or scale OpenSearch clusters.

## Data Engineering Security and Monitoring

### Security

The importance of security in AWS data analytics workflows cannot be overstated. Any breach or compromise could lead to severe consequences including data theft, financial loss, damage to reputation, and regulatory penalties.  
Security should address the following five areas:

- Access management

  Strong access controls are important to ensure only authorized users and applications can access analytics resources and data. With IAM, granular permissions are applied on a per-user or group basis using policies.

- Regulatory compliance

  Many regulations like GDPR and HIPAA mandate that organizations securely manage data and adhere to privacy and security best practices. Non-compliance can result in heavy fines. Using managed services from AWS helps automate common compliance controls and auditing capabilities.

- Sensitive data protection

  Data analytics often involves large volumes of sensitive data such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial records, and health records. These must be protected from unauthorized access, theft, or leakage. AWS provides services like encryption, masking, identity and access management, and data loss prevention to securely manage sensitive data.

- Data and network security

  AWS services like security groups, network access control lists, and firewalls help restrict network access and secure compute and storage resources. Features like encryption-at-rest provide added protection.

- Data auditability 

  It is essential to be able to track the origin, transformation, and flow of data from source to target. You need to know where the data came from, how it was processed, and who and what systems have access to it. With the AWS Glue Data Catalog you can store the table definition and physical location of a dataset, add business-relevant attributes, and track how this data has changed over time.
