## Introduction

### What are the key functions of the data engineer?

[key functions](/img/key-functions.png)

- Build and manage data infrastructure and platforms

    This includes setting up databases, data lakes, and data warehouses on AWS services like Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), AWS Glue, Amazon Redshift, among others. 

- Ingest data from various sources

    You can use tools like AWS Glue jobs or AWS Lambda functions to ingest data from databases, applications, files, and streaming devices into the centralized data platforms. 

- Prepare the ingested data for analytics

    Use technologies like AWS Glue, Apache Spark, or Amazon EMR to prepare data by cleaning, transforming, and enriching it.

- Catalog and document curated datasets

    Use AWS Glue crawlers to determine the format and schema, group data into tables, and write metadata to the AWS Glue Data Catalog. Use metadata tagging in Data Catalog for data governance and discoverability.

- Automate regular data workflows and pipelines

    Simplify and accelerate data processing using services like AWS Glue workflows, AWS Lambda, or AWS Step Functions.

- Ensure data quality, security, and compliance

    Create access controls, establish authorization policies, and build monitoring processes. Use Amazon DataZone or AWS Lake Formation to manage and govern access to data using fine-grained controls. These controls help ensure access with the right level of privileges and context.
