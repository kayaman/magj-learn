## Introduction

### Comparing streaming processing to batch processing

Before setting up a streaming pipeline, consider the differences between batch processing and streaming processing. This will allow you to choose the best process for your use case.

#### Batch processing

Batch processing usually computes results based on complete datasets. This approach supports deep analysis of large datasets and is usually done on a recurring schedule, such as nightly, weekly, or quarterly.

#### Streaming processing

In contrast, a data stream is unbounded. Streaming data is generated continuously by different data sources concurrently. Stream processing involves ingesting a sequence of data and incrementally updating metrics, reports, or summary statistics as new data arrives.  
Organizations can use stream processing to gather data, analyze it quickly, and act on insights in near real time.
