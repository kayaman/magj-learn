Although we don't require that you take any specific training before you take an exam, we do recommend that have the underlying training and knowledge outlined in the exam guide.

If you need to refresh your knowledge, enroll in the Enhanced Exam Prep Plan: [AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer - Associate (MLA-C01)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-engineer-associate/). The learning plan includes all of following the recommended courses. If you are already logged into AWS [Skill Builder](https://skillbuilder.aws/), use this link version to access the plan.
